# notes-website

I understand it's not all fully correct html.
I was building this website for myslef until I was told I needed to make a personal website project.
I built this website to take notes on.
I intend to contnue improving the content, style, and function of this site over the next 4-6 months as I learn more skills and languages.
there's especially a lot of less thans and greater thans I need to turn into &#60;'s and &#62;'s. I also have alot of &nbsp;'s to add.
I also have a lot of nested lists that the browser displays correctly, but I know I have to move my </li>
